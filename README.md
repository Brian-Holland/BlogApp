# BlogApp

Basic blog app allowing users to create a post that will be listed with most recent posts first.

Updated blog app to currently be read-only for portfolio purposes. 

All user-created accounts will be able to see routes for CRUD commands, but only the main admin account will be able to perform those actions.
